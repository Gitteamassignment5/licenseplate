# Car Number Plate Detection and Recognition using YOLOv3 and Pytesseract

I conducted this research project for my bachelor's thesis, implementing an Automatic Number Plate Detection and Recognition system using YOLOv3 and Pytesseract.

The custom YOLOv3 model was trained specifically for car number plates and utilized as a detection model to identify the location of number plates on cars.

Once the number plate is detected, the image is cropped, and various image processing steps are performed using OpenCV.

The processed image is then passed through Pytesseract OCR to extract the text from the number plate.
