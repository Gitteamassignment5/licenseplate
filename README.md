# Car-number-plate-detection-and-recognition-using-Yolov3-and-Pytesseract
I conducted This research project for my bachelor's thesis: an Automatic Number Plate Detection and Recognition system using YOLOv3 and Pytesseract.

The custom Yolov3 was trained on car number plates and used as a detection model to detect the number plate location in a car.

The image is cropped and Opencv conducts various image processing steps. 

The enhanced image is passed through Pytesseract OCR to detect the number plate text.
